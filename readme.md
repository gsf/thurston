Thurston
========
Thurston is a programming language.

Objectives:
1. Full syntax consistency between modules, parameter-less functions, and objects
2. JSON-like syntax for objects and arrays

Therefore:
1. Modules won't be run on require
2. All declared variables are exposed

See the examples directory for thoughts.
