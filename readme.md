# Thurston
Thurston is a programming language.

Objectives:

1. Full syntax consistency between modules and objects
2. JSON-like syntax for objects and arrays
3. Objects are callable

Therefore:

1. Modules won't be run on require
2. All declared variables are exposed

See the examples directory for thoughts.
